A simple react component which renders data as a tree using svg.

The source code for these examples can be found on [github](https://github.com/jpb12/react-tree-graph/tree/gh-pages/code).

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-tree-graph --save
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { Tree } from 'react-tree-graph';

const data = {
	name: 'Parent',
	children: [{
		name: 'Child One'
	}, {
		name: 'Child Two'
	}]
};

<Tree
	data={data}
	height={400}
	width={400}/>);

import { AnimatedTree } from 'react-tree-graph';

<AnimatedTree
	data={data}
	height={400}
	width={400}/>);
```

If you are using webpack, and have [css-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-loader), you can include some default styles with:

```javascript
import 'react-tree-graph/dist/style.css'
```

Alternatively, both the JavaScript and CSS can be included directly from the dist folder with script tags.
